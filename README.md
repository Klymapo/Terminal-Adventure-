After weeks of learning, I finally finished my chekpoint project. I must say that although it was not difficult, it was VERY VERY tedious. 🫠​🫠​



But I was finally able to finish this baby. 😎​🔥​



This is a small RPG game where the player has to choose between several options to advance and the story changes depending on the choices.  ​🎮​👀​⚔️​



(It's my first project, don't expect much content) ​🙏​🙏​😅​



I hope you enjoy it and that you can give me some feedback. 🫂​❤️​



Thank you very much and happy coding!!! ⭐​⭐​💯​💯​💥​💥​
